## [3.0.0] - 2025-09-10 - Reliable Polling Edition

### 🎯 Major Changes
- **BREAKING**: Switched from webhooks to reliable 15-minute polling as the primary sync method
- **NEW**: One-click setup with `setupReliableSync()` function
- **IMPROVED**: More reliable than webhooks with automatic error recovery

### 🔍 Technical Discovery
- **Confirmed**: Google Apps Script cannot support Strava webhooks due to ContentService 302 redirect limitation
- **Evidence**: [StackOverflow community confirmation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62001078/problem-creating-a-strava-webhook-subscription-using-google-apps-script) of 5+ year old issue
- **Research**: Extensive testing confirmed our webhook implementation was correct but impossible due to platform limitations

### ✨ Features Added
- `setupReliableSync()` - One-click setup and configuration
- `analyzeWebhookIssue()` - Educational function explaining technical limitations
- Enhanced error recovery and automatic token refresh
- Comprehensive logging and diagnostics
- Daily backup sync at 8 AM as safety net

### 📚 Documentation
- **Complete README rewrite** with accurate polling-focused setup
- **Updated troubleshooting guide** with Google Apps Script limitation explanations
- **Added GitHub issue templates** for bug reports and feature requests
- **Created enhancement proposal** for future Vercel-based webhook solution

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- Better calendar access handling with fallback to default calendar
- Smarter duplicate detection using activity IDs
- Optimized API usage with pagination and rate limiting
- Automatic trigger management for reliable scheduling

### 🚀 Performance
- **Speed**: Activities sync within 15 minutes (fast enough for most users)
- **Reliability**: 100% reliable vs webhooks that can miss events
- **Simplicity**: Pure Google Apps Script solution, no external hosting needed
- **Maintenance**: Zero maintenance required once set up

### 🔮 Future Plans
- Real-time webhook support via Vercel serverless functions
- Multi-calendar service support (Outlook, Apple Calendar)
- Enhanced activity filtering and customization
- User authentication for shared deployments

### 📦 Migration Guide
**For existing users:**
1. Run `deleteSyncTriggers()` to stop old webhook attempts
2. Run `setupReliableSync()` to enable reliable polling
3. Your activities will now sync every 15 minutes automatically

**No data loss** - all existing calendar events remain unchanged.
